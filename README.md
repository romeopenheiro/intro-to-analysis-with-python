# Introduction to Analysis with Python (2021-10-18)

The course Intermediate Python has teaching material that is available at [Introduction to Analysis with Python](https://milliams.com/courses/data_analysis_python/).

# Preparation

Make sure that you have [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) installed and working before the sessions starts (or another way of writing and executing Python scripts).

The instructions for [installing Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) are available for [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) for [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) and for [MacOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/).

Ensure that you have gone through the setting up of JuypterLab as in the material so that when we start the session, you're ready to go. There's a [video going through this on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak4cJG_6ENM). Check that you can start JupyterLab and launch a "Notebook" in Python 3 mode.
